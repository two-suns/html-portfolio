<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>👋🏼 Hey there! My name is Bryan, and I'm excited to share this portfolio with you. 
  For the past 10+ years, I've been working in the healthcare industry as a security officer, 
  and while I've loved my time there, I'm ready for a new challenge.</p>

<p>🤔 After some serious soul-searching, I've decided to make a career change and dive headfirst 
  into the world of web development. Over the last 2 years, I have been studying data analytics.
  During this time, I learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I find I have a knack for and understanding
  of the principles and syntax that are necessary for web development.</p>

<p>Through various means, I am teaching myself the rest of what I need to know to be successful in this field.
  This website is a big starting point in my journey. Please reach out to me at the email provided in the contact
  section with any advice, project suggestions, or job opportunities.</p>
